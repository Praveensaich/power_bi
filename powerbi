            <h2>Why DAX is the Heart of Power BI Analytics</h2>
            <p>While Power Query (M language) handles data preparation, DAX is where true analytical power resides. It allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create custom calculations (measures) that respond dynamically to user selections.</li>
                <li>Perform time intelligence analysis (Year-to-Date, Month-over-Month, etc.).</li>
                <li>Build complex logic for key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
                <li>Derive new insights that aren't possible with raw data alone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without a solid understanding of DAX, you're only scratching the surface of Power BI's capabilities.</p>

            <h2>DAX Fundamentals: The Building Blocks</h2>
            <p>This section lays the groundwork for writing effective DAX formulas. Mastering these fundamental concepts is crucial before diving into specific functions.</p>

            <section id="calculated-vs-measures">
                <h3>Calculated Columns vs. Measures: A Core Distinction</h3>
                <p>Understanding when to use a calculated column versus a measure is foundational for efficient data modeling and accurate reporting.</p>

                <h4>Calculated Columns</h4>
                <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Calculated columns are new columns added to an existing table in your data model. Their values are computed and stored in the model's memory (VertiPaq engine) when the data is refreshed. They are evaluated row-by-row within the context of that row.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Static, row-level calculations that don't change based on filters applied in a report. Good for categorizations, simple concatenations, or fixed ratios per row.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Increase model size and refresh time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Syntax Example:</strong> Creating a 'Full Name' calculated column by combining 'First Name' and 'Last Name'.</p>
                <pre><code>Full Name = 'Customers'[First Name] & " " & 'Customers'[Last Name]</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong> In this example, for every row in the 'Customers' table, DAX takes the value from the 'First Name' column in that specific row, adds a space, and then appends the 'Last Name' value from the same row. The result is stored as a new column.</p>
                <p><strong>When NOT to use:</strong> Avoid for aggregations (like sum of sales), as these would calculate for every row and then you'd need to aggregate them in visuals, which is inefficient. Also, avoid for complex dynamic calculations.</p>

                <h4>Measures</h4>
                <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Measures are dynamic calculations that are computed on the fly based on the current filter context in your report. Their results are *not* stored in the data model, making them highly efficient for aggregation and dynamic analysis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX), time intelligence calculations (YTD, MoM), complex KPIs, and any calculation that needs to react to user filters (slicers, visual interactions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Do not increase model size. Calculated only when needed by a visual.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Syntax Example:</strong> Calculating 'Total Sales'.</p>
                <pre><code>Total Sales = SUM('Sales'[SalesAmount])</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong> When you drag 'Total Sales' into a visual, DAX evaluates this measure based on whatever filters are currently applied. If you filter by "Region = North", it sums sales *only* for the North region. If you then add "Product Category = Bikes", it sums sales for Bikes *within* the North region.</p>
                <p><strong>When NOT to use:</strong> Cannot be used directly as a row in a table visual (e.g., you can't put `[Total Sales]` directly into a row of a matrix visual without a grouping column). Cannot be used directly in row context functions without careful handling (e.g., within `SUMX` if not defined correctly).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="evaluation-context">
                <h3>Evaluation Context: The Heart of DAX</h3>
                <p>Understanding how DAX evaluates formulas based on the surrounding context is the single most important concept in mastering the language. There are two primary types of context:</p>

                <h4>1. Row Context</h4>
                <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Row context refers to the "current row" being evaluated. It's an implicit loop that DAX performs. When you write a calculated column, DAX automatically creates a row context for each row of that table. For measures, row context is typically introduced explicitly by "iterator" functions (functions ending in 'X', e.g., `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Where it appears:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Automatically in calculated columns.</li>
                            <li>Explicitly in `ITERATOR` functions like `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, `MAXX`, `MINX`, `COUNTX`, `CONCATENATEX`.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example (Calculated Column - Implicit Row Context):</strong></p>
                <pre><code>Order Line Profit = 'Sales'[Quantity] * ('Sales'[Unit Price] - 'Sales'[Cost])</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For each individual row in the 'Sales' table, DAX accesses the `Quantity`, `Unit Price`, and `Cost` values *from that specific row* to calculate the `Order Line Profit` for that row.</p>

                <p><strong>Example (Measure with Iterator - Explicit Row Context):</strong></p>
                <pre><code>Total Revenue from Sales Lines = SUMX(
    'Sales',
    'Sales'[Quantity] * 'Sales'[Unit Price]
)</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> `SUMX` iterates row by row over the 'Sales' table. For each row, it calculates `Quantity * Unit Price` within that row's context, and then `SUMX` aggregates all those individual results. This is powerful because it allows row-level calculations *before* aggregation.</p>

                <h4>2. Filter Context</h4>
                <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Filter context is the set of filters currently applied to your data model. These filters determine which subset of data is being considered for a calculation. Filters can come from various sources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> Filters implicitly applied by rows/columns in a matrix, axis categories in a chart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slicers:</strong> User selections on slicers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Report-level/Page-level/Visual-level Filters:</strong> Filters set in the Power BI filter pane.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Filters propagate across related tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>DAX Functions:</strong> Explicitly modified by functions like `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `ALL`, `ALLEXCEPT`, `KEEPFILTERS`.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example (Implicit Filter Context):</strong> If you have a slicer for 'Region' and select "North", any measure you display (like `[Total Sales]`) will automatically show sales only for the North region because the filter context has been applied.</p>

                <p><strong>Example (Explicit Filter Context with CALCULATE):</strong> `CALCULATE` is the most powerful DAX function because it allows you to *modify* the filter context for an expression.</p>
                <pre><code>Sales for East Region = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    'Geography'[Region] = "East"
)</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Even if your report is currently filtered to "West Region", this measure will *temporarily override* that filter (or add to it if no region filter exists) to calculate `[Total Sales]` specifically for the "East" region, regardless of other filters.</p>

                <p><strong>Example (Removing Filters with ALL):</strong></p>
                <pre><code>Total Sales All Products = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    ALL('Product') // Removes all filters from the entire Products table
)</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This measure calculates the `[Total Sales]` ignoring any filters that might be applied to the 'Product' table (e.g., from a Product Category slicer or a Product Name in a visual). This is essential for calculating percentages of total.</p>

                <p><strong>Example (Keeping Filters with KEEPFILTERS):</strong></p>
                <pre><code>Sales for Current Filtered Category Only = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    KEEPFILTERS(Products[Category] = "Clothing") // If report is filtered by "Footwear", it will only show "Clothing" sales within "Footwear" which is 0. If no filter, it shows clothing.
)</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> `KEEPFILTERS` interacts with existing filters by retaining them and adding the new filter. Without `KEEPFILTERS`, a new filter context from `CALCULATE` would replace conflicting filters.</p>

                <h4>Context Transition</h4>
                <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Context transition is the process by which row context is converted into filter context. This implicitly occurs when a measure (which typically evaluates in filter context) is called from within a row context (e.g., in a calculated column or inside an iterator function).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculating 'Sales per Customer' as a calculated column in the 'Customers' table.</p>
                <pre><code>Sales Per Customer (Calculated Column) = [Total Sales]</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For each row in the 'Customers' table (which has row context), when `[Total Sales]` (a measure) is called, DAX performs a context transition. It takes the values from the current row (e.g., `CustomerID = 123`) and converts them into a filter context (effectively `FILTER(ALL(Customers), Customers[CustomerID] = 123)`). Then, `[Total Sales]` is evaluated under this new filter context, giving you the total sales *for that specific customer*.</p>

            <section id="filter-functions">
                <h3>5. Filter Functions</h3>
                <p>These functions are critical for manipulating the filter context in your DAX expressions. `CALCULATE` is the cornerstone.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>CALCULATE()</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluates an expression in a context modified by filters. It's the most powerful and frequently used DAX function.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>CALCULATE(<expression>, <filter1> [, <filter2>...])</code></p>
                    <p><strong>Example 1 (Adding a Filter):</strong> Calculate sales for a specific product category.</p>
                    <pre><code>Sales of Electronics = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    Products[Category] = "Electronics"
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This measure overrides or adds a filter to the current context, forcing the calculation of `[Total Sales]` only for products where the 'Category' is "Electronics".</p>

                    <p><strong>Example 2 (Removing Filters with ALL):</strong> Calculate total sales irrespective of product filters.</p>
                    <pre><code>Total Sales All Products = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    ALL(Products) // Removes all filters from the entire Products table
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Useful for "percentage of total" calculations. If you put `[Total Sales]` next to `[Total Sales All Products]` and filter by category, the first will change, but the second will remain constant.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example 3 (Keeping Filters with KEEPFILTERS):</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>Sales for Current Filtered Category Only = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    KEEPFILTERS(Products[Category] = "Clothing") // If report is filtered by "Footwear", it will only show "Clothing" sales within "Footwear" which is 0. If no filter, it shows clothing.
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> `KEEPFILTERS` interacts with existing filters by retaining them and adding the new filter. Without `KEEPFILTERS`, a new filter context from `CALCULATE` would replace conflicting conflicting filters.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>FILTER()</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Returns a table filtered by a boolean expression. Often used as a table argument within other functions (especially `CALCULATE` or iterator functions).</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>FILTER(<table>, <filter_expression>)</code></p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sum of sales for high-value customers (customers with total sales > $1000).</p>
                    <pre><code>High Value Customer Sales =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    FILTER(
        Customers,
        CALCULATE([Total Sales], Customers) > 1000 // Sub-calculate sales per customer
    )
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This formula first filters the `Customers` table to include only those customers whose `[Total Sales]` (when evaluated for that specific customer) exceed 1000. Then, it calculates the `[Total Sales]` for that filtered set of customers. This demonstrates `FILTER` creating a table expression that `CALCULATE` then uses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example (Calculated Column in Sales Table):</strong> Get the Product Category name into the Sales table.</p>
                    <pre><code>Product Category = RELATED('Product'[CategoryName])</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For each row in the 'Sales' table, this looks up the related 'Product' table based on the relationship and fetches the 'CategoryName' for that product. Requires an active relationship.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>RELATEDTABLE()</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Returns a table that contains all rows from the 'many' side of a relationship that are related to the current row on the 'one' side. Useful within iterator functions or `CALCULATE` to filter a related table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>RELATEDTABLE(<table>)</code></p>
                    <p><strong>Example (Calculated Column in Product Table):</strong> Count how many sales orders each product has.</p>
                    <pre><code>Number of Sales Orders = COUNTROWS(RELATEDTABLE(Sales))</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For each product in the 'Product' table, `RELATEDTABLE(Sales)` returns a table containing *only* the sales rows associated with that specific product. `COUNTROWS` then counts those related sales rows.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>USERELATIONSHIP()</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Specifies an inactive relationship to be used for a specific calculation. Useful when you have multiple relationships between two tables and need to activate a specific one for a measure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>USERELATIONSHIP(<column1>, <column2>)</code></p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculate Sales by Order Date and Sales by Ship Date (where only Order Date is active).</p>
                    <pre><code>Sales by Ship Date = CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ShipDate], 'Date'[Date])
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If 'Sales'[OrderDate] is the active relationship to 'Date'[Date], this measure temporarily activates the inactive relationship between 'Sales'[ShipDate] and 'Date'[Date] *only for this calculation*, allowing you to analyze sales based on ship date filters.</p>

                <h3>7. Table Manipulation & Variable Functions</h3>
                <p>Functions that return tables or help structure complex DAX formulas for readability and performance.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>VAR (Variables)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Defines variables to store the result of an expression. Variables improve readability, simplify complex formulas, and significantly boost performance by preventing redundant calculations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong>
                    <pre><code>VAR <variable_name> = <expression>
RETURN
    <expression_using_variable(s)></code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculate percentage of total sales for selected products.</p>
                    <pre><code>% Sales of Selected Products =
VAR CurrentSales = [Total Sales]
VAR AllSelectedSales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], ALLSELECTED(Products))
RETURN
    DIVIDE(CurrentSales, AllSelectedSales, 0)
</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> `CurrentSales` stores the total sales under the current filter context. `AllSelectedSales` stores the total sales for all products currently visible in the report (ignoring product-specific filters applied within the visual). Using variables prevents `[Total Sales]` from being calculated multiple times, improving efficiency.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>ADDCOLUMNS()</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Adds calculated columns to an existing or virtual table expression.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>ADDCOLUMNS(<table>, <name1>, <expression1> [, <name2>, <expression2>...])</code></p>
                    <p><strong>Example (Virtual Table for Top Customers):</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>Top 10 Customers by Sales =
TOPN(
    10,
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(Sales, Customers[CustomerName]),
        "Customer Sales", [Total Sales]
    ),
    "Customer Sales"
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This creates a temporary table that summarizes sales by customer name, adds a calculated column "Customer Sales" to it using the `[Total Sales]` measure for each customer, and then returns the top 10 rows from that table based on "Customer Sales".</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>SUMMARIZE()</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Returns a summary table for the requested totals over a set of groups. Similar to GROUP BY in SQL.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>SUMMARIZE(<table>, <groupBy_columnName1> [, <groupBy_columnName2>...][, <name1>, <expression1>...])</code></p>
                    <p><strong>Example (Sales by Category and Year):</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>Sales By Category & Year = SUMMARIZE(
    Sales,
    Product[Category],
    'Date'[Calendar Year],
    "Total Sales Amount", [Total Sales]
)</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This creates a virtual table with 'Product Category' and 'Calendar Year' columns, and a measure `Total Sales Amount` that sums `[Total Sales]` for each unique combination of category and year.</p>

            <h2>Advanced DAX Concepts & Patterns</h2>
            <p>Move beyond the basics to master complex scenarios.</p>

            <h3>Context Transition Demystified</h3>
            <p><strong>Theory:</strong> How row context gets converted into filter context. This happens implicitly when a measure is evaluated in a row context (e.g., within an iterator function or a calculated column).</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculating "Sales per Customer" in a customer table. If you use `[Total Sales]` directly, it will perform context transition to calculate sales for each customer.</p>
            <pre><code>Sales Per Customer (Calculated Column) = [Total Sales]</code></pre>
            <p>(Here, `[Total Sales]` which is a measure, implicitly transitions the row context of the Customer table into a filter context for that specific customer).</p>

            <h3>Iterator Functions (`X` functions like `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`)</h3>
            <p><strong>Theory:</strong> These functions iterate over each row of a specified table and perform an expression for each row, then aggregate the results. They introduce a row context for the expression.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculating 'Net Sales' considering discounts applied per line item.</p>
            <pre><code>Net Sales = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice] * (1 - Sales[Discount]))</code></pre>

            <h3>DAX Patterns</h3>
            <p>Common, reusable DAX solutions for typical business problems. Learning these patterns can significantly speed up your development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Year-over-Year Growth:</strong> Compare current year's performance to last year's.</li>
                <li><strong>Running Totals:</strong> Cumulative sums over time.</li>
                <li><strong>New vs. Returning Customers:</strong> Identify customer segments based on their first purchase date.</li>
                <li><strong>ABC Analysis:</strong> Categorize items (e.g., products) based on their value contribution.</li>
                <li>... (Detailed examples for each pattern would be here) ...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Performance Optimization in DAX</h3>
            <p>Tips for writing efficient DAX that performs well, especially with large datasets.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Data Model Design:** A well-designed star schema is paramount.</li>
                <li>**Minimize Calculated Columns:** Use measures whenever possible.</li>
                <li>**Use Variables (<code>VAR</code>):** Improve readability and avoid re-evaluating expressions.</li>
                <li>**Avoid Bidirectional Relationships (if possible):** Manage filter propagation carefully.</li>
                <li>**Utilize DAX Studio:** A powerful external tool for analyzing and optimizing DAX queries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Power BI: An End-to-End Development Guide</h2>
            <p>DAX is a crucial part, but Power BI is a full lifecycle tool.</p>

            <section id="stage1-get-data">
                <h3>Stage 1: Get Data (Data Acquisition)</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Connect to various data sources and import raw data into Power BI Desktop.</p>
                <h4>Key Considerations:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Source Identification:</strong> Where does the required data reside? (Databases, Excel, CSV, SharePoint, Web APIs, Data Lakes, SaaS apps).</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection Methods:</strong> DirectQuery vs. Import vs. Live Connection.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Import:</strong> Data is loaded into Power BI's VertiPaq engine. Fast performance, but data is static until refreshed.</li>
                            <li><strong>DirectQuery:</strong> Data remains in the source. Queries are sent to the source. Good for very large datasets or real-time data, but can be slower for complex visuals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Live Connection:</strong> Primarily for SSAS Tabular or Azure Analysis Services. No data loaded into Power BI model, leverages existing model.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Volume & Performance:</strong> Choose connection method based on data size and refresh frequency needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credentials & Security:</strong> Ensuring secure access to data sources.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Practical Steps in Power BI Desktop:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click "Get Data" from the Home tab.</li>
                    <li>Select appropriate connector (e.g., SQL Server database, Excel workbook, Web).</li>
                    <li>Configure connection details (server name, database, file path, URL).</li>
                    <li>Choose tables/sheets to load.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Connecting to an Azure SQL Database.</p>
                <pre><code>// Power BI Desktop interface steps:
// 1. Get Data -> Azure SQL Database
// 2. Enter Server, Database (Optional)
// 3. Choose Data Connectivity Mode: Import or DirectQuery
// 4. Navigate tables and Load/Transform Data</code></pre>

            <section id="stage2-transform-data">
                <h3>Stage 2: Transform Data (Power Query / M Language)</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Clean, reshape, and combine raw data into a clean, optimized, and ready-for-modeling format. This happens in the Power Query Editor.</p>
                <h4>Key ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleansing:</strong> Handling nulls, errors, duplicates; correcting data types; removing unnecessary columns/rows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Reshaping:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>**Pivoting/Unpivoting:** Transforming rows to columns or vice-versa to achieve the correct tabular structure.</li>
                            <li>**Merging/Appending Queries:** Combining data from different sources or tables (joins and unions).</li>
                            <li>**Splitting/Extracting Columns:** Breaking down a single column into multiple, or extracting parts of strings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Enrichment:</strong> Creating custom columns using Power Query's M language (e.g., conditional columns, date parts).</li>
                    <li><strong>Query Folding:</strong> Ensuring Power Query operations are translated back to the source system for faster processing (critical for large datasets).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Practical Steps in Power BI Editor:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>After "Get Data", click "Transform Data" to open Power Query Editor.</li>
                    <li>Apply various transformations using the ribbon options or by writing custom M code in the Advanced Editor.</li>
                    <li>Review "Applied Steps" to track changes.</li>
                    <li>"Close & Apply" to load the transformed data into the data model.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Example (M Language):</strong> Unpivoting month columns to a single 'Month' and 'Value' column.</p>
                <pre><code>// Sample M Code from Power Query Advanced Editor
let
    Source = Csv.Document(File.Contents("C:\Data\SalesData.csv"),[Delimiter=",", Columns=4, Encoding=65001, QuoteStyle=QuoteStyle.None]),
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
    #"Unpivoted Other Columns" = Table.UnpivotOtherColumns(#"Promoted Headers", {"Product", "Region"}, "Month", "Sales Value")
in
    #"Unpivoted Other Columns"</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Keep queries simple, remove unnecessary data early, manage query dependencies.</p>

            <section id="stage3-model-data">
                <h3>Stage 3: Model Data (Relationships & DAX)</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a robust, scalable, and efficient data model that supports complex analysis and reporting. This is where DAX comes into play.</p>
                <h4>Key Modeling Tasks:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Relationship Management:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Star Schema Design:</strong> The gold standard. Separate Fact (transactional) tables from Dimension (lookup) tables.</li>
                            <li><strong>Creating Relationships:</strong> Connecting tables based on common keys. Understand cardinality (one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many) and cross-filter direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Active vs. Inactive Relationships:</strong> Knowing when to use `USERELATIONSHIP`.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bidirectional Filtering:</strong> Use sparingly and with caution due to potential ambiguity and performance impact.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>DAX Measures & Calculated Columns:</strong> (Refer to DAX sections for details)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing business logic, aggregations, time intelligence, and KPIs.</li>
                            <li>Choosing between calculated columns and measures appropriately.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Categorization & Formatting:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Setting correct data types, summarization behavior.</li>
                            <li>Applying format strings (currency, date, percentage).</li>
                            <li>Categorizing columns (e.g., city, state, country for map visuals).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchies:</strong> Creating logical drill-down paths (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month > Day for dates; Category > Subcategory > Product for products).</li>
                    <li><strong>Row-Level Security (RLS):</strong> Defining roles and rules using DAX to restrict data access based on user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimizing Model Size:</strong> Hiding unnecessary columns, removing redundant data, optimizing data types.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example (DAX for RLS):</strong> Defining a role to only see data for their specific region.</p>
                <pre><code>[Region] = LOOKUPVALUE('Users'[Region], 'Users'[Email], USERPRINCIPALNAME())</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Aim for a clean star schema, hide foreign keys, and use measures over calculated columns for aggregations.</p>

                <h3>Data Modeling Questions</h3>

                <article class="interview-question">
                    <h4>1. What is a Star Schema and why is it preferred in Power BI?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Star Schema is a data modeling approach where a central "fact" table (containing measures/metrics) is connected to multiple "dimension" tables (containing descriptive attributes). It's preferred in Power BI because it simplifies data relationships, improves query performance (especially for DAX), and makes reports easier to understand and build.</p>

                    <h4>2. Explain Fact and Dimension tables. Give examples.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fact Table:</strong> Contains quantitative data (measures) and foreign keys to dimension tables. It records events or transactions.
                                <em>Example:</em> A `Sales` table with columns like `SalesAmount`, `Quantity`, `OrderID`, `ProductID`, `CustomerID`, `DateID`.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dimension Table:</strong> Contains descriptive attributes related to the facts. They provide context to the measures.
                                <em>Example:</em> A `Product` table with `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Category`, `Brand`. A `Customer` table with `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `City`, `Region`. A `Date` table with `DateID`, `Year`, `Month`, `Day`.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4>3. What is cardinality in Power BI relationships? Name the types.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Cardinality defines the number of unique values in one column relative to another in a relationship. It describes how rows in one table relate to rows in another.
                        Types:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>One-to-Many (1:*) - Most Common:</strong> One record in the primary table relates to many records in the related table (e.g., one customer has many sales).</li>
                            <li><strong>Many-to-One (*:1):</strong> The inverse of one-to-many (e.g., many sales records belong to one customer).</li>
                            <li><strong>One-to-One (1:1):</strong> One record in the primary table relates to exactly one record in the related table (rare in BI, often means tables can be merged).</li>
                            <li><strong>Many-to-Many (*:*):</strong> Many records in one table relate to many records in another (requires a bridging/junction table in Power BI).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>4. What is a bridging table (or junction table) and when do you use it?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A bridging table is an intermediate table used to resolve a many-to-many relationship between two tables in Power BI. It typically contains foreign keys from both tables involved in the many-to-many relationship. You use it when a direct relationship would result in incorrect aggregations or filtering due to ambiguity.</p>

                    <h4>5. How do you handle inactive relationships in Power BI?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Inactive relationships are typically used when there are multiple ways to relate two tables (e.g., an Order Date and a Ship Date between a Sales table and a Date table). You activate an inactive relationship for a specific calculation using the `USERELATIONSHIP` DAX function within a `CALCULATE` statement.</p>

                    <h4>1. What is Power Query and what is its purpose?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Power Query is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool within Power BI (and Excel) that allows users to connect to various data sources, clean and transform data, and load it into the data model. Its purpose is to prepare raw data into a clean, structured, and optimized format suitable for analysis and reporting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Query Folding is the ability of Power Query to translate transformation steps back into the native query language of the data source (e.g., SQL for a SQL database). This allows the data source to perform the heavy lifting of data transformation, sending only the final, processed data to Power BI. It's crucial for performance, especially with large datasets, as it reduces data transfer and leverages the source system's processing power.</p>

                    <h4>3. What is the M language?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> M is the functional programming language behind Power Query. Every transformation step you apply in the Power Query Editor (like removing columns, changing data types, merging queries) generates M code. You can view and edit this code in the Advanced Editor.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Merge Queries:</strong> Used to combine columns from two or more tables based on matching values in one or more common columns (similar to SQL JOIN operations). You use it when you want to add more descriptive attributes to your fact table from dimension tables.</li>
                            <li><strong>Append Queries:</strong> Used to combine rows from two or more tables into a single new table (similar to SQL UNION ALL). You use it when tables have the same structure but contain data for different periods or segments (e.g., Sales data from Jan, Feb, March files).</li>

                <h3>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Questions</h3>

                <article class="interview-question">
                    <h4>1. What is DAX and what are its main components?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI, SSAS Tabular, and Excel Power Pivot to create custom calculations. Its main components are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Dynamic calculations aggregated on the fly (e.g., Total Sales, Average Profit).</li>
                            <li><strong>Calculated Columns:</strong> New columns added to a table, calculated row-by-row and stored in the model (e.g., Full Name, Age Group).</li>
                            <li><strong>Calculated Tables:</strong> New tables created using DAX expressions (e.g., a Date table, a summary table).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <article class="interview-question">
                    <h4>2. Explain Row Context and Filter Context in DAX.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Row Context:</strong> The "current row" being evaluated. It's implicit in calculated columns (each row is evaluated individually) and explicitly created by iterator functions (functions ending in 'X' like `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`) that loop through a table row by row.</li>
                            <li><strong>Filter Context:</strong> The set of filters applied to the data model at a given point in time. These filters come from visuals, slicers, report-level filters, or relationships, and determine which data subset is being considered for a calculation.</li>
                        </ul>

                <article class="interview-question">
                    <h4>3. What is Context Transition? Give an example.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Context Transition is the process where a row context is converted into an equivalent filter context. This happens implicitly when a measure (which normally evaluates in filter context) is called from within a row context (e.g., in a calculated column or inside an iterator function).
                        <em>Example:</em> If you create a calculated column `Sales Per Customer = [Total Sales]` in your `Customer` table, for each customer row, the row context of that customer is converted into a filter context for that specific customer, and then `[Total Sales]` is calculated for that filtered customer.</p>

                    <h4>4. What is the purpose of the `CALCULATE` function?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> `CALCULATE` is the most powerful and versatile DAX function. Its primary purpose is to evaluate an expression (usually a measure) under a modified filter context. It can add new filters, remove existing filters (`ALL`, `ALLEXCEPT`), or modify existing filters (`KEEPFILTERS`). It's essential for almost all advanced DAX calculations.</p>

                    <h4>5. When would you use `ALL` vs. `ALLEXCEPT` vs. `ALLSELECTED`?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> These are filter modifier functions used within `CALCULATE`:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>`ALL(<table>)` or `ALL(<column>)`:</strong> Removes all filters from the specified table or column. Useful for calculating percentages of a grand total.</li>
                            <li><strong>`ALLEXCEPT(<table>, <column1>, <column2>...)`:</strong> Removes all filters from the specified table *except* for the filters on the specified columns. Useful for keeping certain filters while removing others.</li>
                            <li><strong>`ALLSELECTED()`:</strong> Removes filters that are *not* from slicers or report filters, but keeps filters from slicers/report filters. It's useful for calculating percentages of a subtotal based on current visual selection.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Date table is a dimension table containing a continuous range of dates and associated attributes (Year, Month, Quarter, Day of Week, etc.). You can create it using DAX (`CALENDAR` or `CALENDARAUTO`) or in Power Query. It's crucial for:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing time intelligence functions (YTD, MoM, YoY) accurately.</li>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> DAX variables (`VAR`) allow you to store the result of an expression within a DAX formula. They are useful because:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Break down complex formulas into smaller, manageable parts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The expression assigned to a variable is calculated only once, even if the variable is referenced multiple times, preventing redundant calculations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Easier to debug by inspecting intermediate results.</li>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Row-Level Security (RLS) is a feature in Power BI that restricts data access for specified users. You define roles and DAX rules within Power BI Desktop, and when users view reports in the Power BI Service, they only see the data allowed by their assigned role. This ensures data privacy and compliance without creating separate reports for each user/group.</p>
